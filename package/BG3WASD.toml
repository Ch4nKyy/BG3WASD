# Default config that is packaged with the mod

# Foreword: Key names are in Larian style, e.g. key:w, shift+key:w, mouse:middle or key:lshift.
# For the names of all available keys, see the bottom of this config file.


[ModHotkeys]
# The ModHotkeys are region DEPENDANT!!! AZERTY keyboard users must adapt them!

HoldWalkOrSprint = ""
# When you are sprinting, holding this key will make you walk.
# If you are walking, holding this key will make you sprint.

ReloadConfig = "key:f11"
# This will reload all config values.
# If possible, it will also force the game to reload its inputconfig.

ToggleAutorun = "shift+key:w"
# Lets you move without holding Forward.
# AZERTY users should set it to shift+key:z.

ToggleCharacterOrCamera = "key:capslock"
# Key that toggles between Character and Camera movement mode.

ToggleWalkOrSprint = "key:insert"
# Toggle between walking and sprinting movespeed.

ToggleCameraRotate = ""
# The Camera Rotate command from the main menu must be held, but this key allows a real toggle for
# a semi mouselook.
# For this key to work, Camera Rotate must still be bound to another key without modifiers in the
# game menu!
# Unfortunately, the toggle does not work inversely. So if you toggle to mouselook, holding
# Camera Rotate will not show the cursor when held.
# Requires ImprovedMouseRotation = true.


[Movement]

WalkSpeed = 0.3
# 1.0 would be sprinting speed. 0.5 would be 50% of that. [0.0, 1.0]

WalkingIsDefault = false
# Whether the character walks, when the game starts up. [true, false]

ToggleCharacterOrCameraAlsoTogglesCameraRotate = false
# When true, toggling the movement mode will also toggle camera rotate. 
# This works together with AutoTogglingWasdMode!
# Small hint: Usually the mod starts in Character mode. But when this option is true, it will start
# in Camera mode due to technical reasons.
# Requires ImprovedMouseRotation = true.
# [true, false]


[EnableFeatures]
# Allows to enable or disable certain features of this mod.
# These settings can NOT be hot reloaded, but require a game restart!

AutoTogglingWasdMode = true
# Automatically toggle WASD mode depending on the context. 
# Toggle to Camera movement, when combat starts, and back to Character movement, when combat ends.
# Doesn't work perfectly yet. Sometimes you have to toggle manually.
# [true, false]

ImprovedMouseRotation = true
# Hide the mouse cursor and disable Interact (usually left click) during rotation.
# Enable Rotate+LeftClick = Move Forward
# Provide key ToggleCameraRotate and option ToggleCharacterOrCameraAlsoTogglesCameraRotate.
# [true, false]
