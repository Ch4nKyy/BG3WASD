# For the names of all available keys, see the bottom of this config file.
# The ModHotkeys are region DEPENDANT!!! AZERTY keyboard users must adapt them!


ToggleMovementMode = "key:capslock"
# Key that toggles between Character and Camera movement mode.

HoldWalkspeed = ""
# When you are jogging, holding this key will make you walk.
# If you are walking, holding this key will make you jog.

ToggleWalkspeed = "key:insert"
# Toggles between walking and jogging movespeed.

ReloadConfig = "key:f11"
# This will hot reload all config values and the inputconfig.

ToggleAutoforward = "shift+key:w"
# Lets you move forward without holding Forward.
# AZERTY users should set it to shift+key:z.

ToggleMouselook = ""
# The Camera Rotate command from the main menu must be held, but this key offers a real toggle for
# mouselook.
# For this key to work, Camera Rotate must still be bound to another key without modifiers in the
# game menu!
# Unfortunately, the toggle does not work inversely, yet. So if you toggle to mouselook, holding
# Camera Rotate will not show the cursor when held.
# Requires EnableMouselook = true.

# 1.0 would be jog speed. 0.5 would be 50% of that. [0.0, 1.0]

WalkingIsDefault = false

[AutoToggleMovementMode]

EnableAutoTogglingMovementMode = true
# Automatically toggle movement mode depending on the context. 
# Toggle to Camera movement, when combat starts, and back to Character movement, when combat ends.
# [true, false]


[Mouselook]

EnableMouselook = true
# Hides the mouse cursor and disable Interact (usually left click) during rotation.
# Enable Rotate+LeftClick = Move Forward
# [true, false]

ToggleMovementModeAlsoTogglesMouselook = false
# When true, toggling the movement mode will also toggle mouselook. 
# This works together with AutoTogglingWasdMode!

EnableRightclickMouselookFix = true
# Improves the gameplay for players that bind Camera Rotate to Right Mouse Button.
# Without this feature enabled, Camera Rotate will collide with Cancel Action and Context Menu.
# Also works with any other key than Rightclick, but Rightclick is most commonly used.
# [true, false]

RightclickThreshold = 200
# Threshold in milliseconds where the mod distinguishes between Camera Rotate and Context Menu.
