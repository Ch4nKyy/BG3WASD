# Default config that is packaged with the mod

# Foreword: Key names are in Larian style, e.g. key:w, shift+key:w or key:lshift.
# For the names of all available keys, see the bottom of this config file.

# These hotkeys are automatically patched to the inputconfig_p1.json.
# E.g. Forward is bound to CharacterMoveForward and CameraForward.
# To deactivate this feature, leave them empty: '' or ' '
# The GameHotkeys are region independant, so AZERTY keyboard users DON'T need to change them.

Right = 'key:d'

# If a game update breaks the mod so that WASD is still successfully unlocked, but the Toggle
# feature is not, then these hotkeys are automatically patched to the inputconfig_p1.json.
# This is done so that you can still move both the character and the camera and avoid conflicts.
# To deactivate this feature, leave them empty: '' or ' '
# The FallbackHotkeys are region independant, so AZERTY keyboard users DON'T need to change them.

[EnableFeatures]

#    -ToggleCharacterOrCamera
#    -ToggleWalkOrSprint and HoldWalkOrSprint

# Hint for left-handed gamers that use PL;'
# You have to surround the single quote key with double quotes, like this: xxxxx = "key:'"
