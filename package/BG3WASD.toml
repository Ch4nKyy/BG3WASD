ReloadConfig = "key:f11"

ToggleMouselook = ""
# The Camera Rotate command from the main menu must be held, but this key offers a real toggle for
# mouselook.
# For this key to work, Camera Rotate must still be bound to another key without modifiers in the
# game menu!
# Unfortunately, the toggle does not work inversely, yet. So if you toggle to mouselook, holding
# Camera Rotate will not show the cursor when held.
