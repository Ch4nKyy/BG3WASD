# When you are jogging, holding this key will make you walk.
# If you are walking, holding this key will make you jog.

ToggleWalkspeed = "key:insert"
# Toggles between walking and jogging movespeed.

ReloadConfig = "key:f11"
# This will hot reload all config values and the inputconfig.

ToggleAutoforward = "shift+key:w"
# Lets you move forward without holding Forward.
# AZERTY users should set it to shift+key:z.

WalkingIsDefault = false
# Whether the character walks, when the game starts up. [true, false]

SwitchToWalkingAfterCombat = false
# Whether to switch to walking, when combat ends. [true, false]

# Hides the mouse cursor and disables Interact (usually left click) during rotation.
# [true, false]

EnableRotatePlusLeftclickMovesForward = true

# [true, false]

RotateThreshold = 200
# This threshold is only of interest, when you bind Camera Rotate to the same key as Context Menu and Cancel Action.
# E.g. when you want to bind Rotate to Rightclick.
# In that case, it is the threshold in milliseconds where the mod distinguishes between Rotate and other commands.
# [0, 2000]

BlockInteractMove = false
# During Character movement mode, block Interact (usually Leftclick) from moving your character.
